Ian Parks, who claims the world’s “worst luck” with women, understands the catharsis of music. “Songwriting is the ultimate therapy,” he says. Out of this came the fist album Sweet Country Lullabies, which contains 11 songs that are Ian’s first attempt to put pain to paper in the country genre. The band at this point is actually a temporary collection of friends. Nonetheless, the style and tenor that becomes fully developed later is very apparent. 
<br>
<br>The band name was originally Starlet, as in a minor star twinkling in the firmament. After registering the name StarletsWeb.com, Ina discovered a Swedish group named Starlet. He was stumped until coming up with the modifier. Figuring The American Starlet was too pretentious, he settled on An American Starlet.
<br>
<br>Ian felt San Francisco wasn’t a nurturing environment for his poignant country music. He moved to Seattle, where there were friends and family. This was the seminal event for the present band. Ian rented a room in the house of his friend Liz Green. After hearing her sing, he realized this was the singing partner he needed. When Liz agreed, Ian began looking for additional musicians by placing ads in the local paper and on the Internet. He quickly received calls from drummer Stefan LaMotte and bassist Todd Gehman. Developing an immediate rapport with both, he invited them to join the band. Ian met Charley Rowan at a party and another similar soul was found.
<br>
<br>It is the “vibe” of these particular people coming together that has created the unique and passionate sound of their release, The Duchess of Hazard. Ian brought lyrics and a melody to rehearsal and, in a collaborative effort, the song was formed and finished by the ensemble. Ian insists it is the musicians’ “natural instincts” that ultimately write the music.
<br>
<br>The Duchess of Hazard is a modern masterpiece of the country roots genre. Its unique blend of country and folk music is at once slow and energetic, young and old, soft and passionate. There is a relentless energy behind the surface lethargy of the tempo. It is the basic human drive to persevere in the face of adversity which comes through – that part of us that keeps trying no matter how many times we fail.
<br>
<br>The songs are melodic and the harmonies sublime. The voices of Ian and Liz blend, build and dance together. Ian’s voice just drips lonely anguish. Liz’s conveys feeling and poignancy in a warm husky tone. Traditional instrumentation includes acoustic guitar, mandolin, banjo, fiddle and bass. These are augmented by a haunting pedal steel, electric guitar, B3 and C2 organ, piano, accordion and drums.

It is true 
<br>that the despair and depression born of a broken heart will resonate within 
<br>me, but only if the song is creatively composed of lyrics, melody and is 
<br>beautifully performed. "The Duchess of Hazard," both the title song and the 
<br>album, have these qualities.
<br>
<br>This young band from Seattle have created a unique blend of country and 
<br>folk music. It is at once slow and energetic, young and old, soft and 
<br>passionate. I shall boldly declare this a modern-day masterpiece of roots 
<br>music. The lyrics track those same old stories - the only stories our 
<br>hearts and loins know. Yet, by the hand of the master what was old is new 
<br>again.
<br>
<br>The songs are not just beautifully written - they are crafted. No song 
<br>credits appear anywhere on the album, press materials, or their web site. 
<br>However, it is clear that Ian Parks is the driving force behind the group 
<br>and his fingerprints are all over the place. Though, I'm sure he would say 
<br>that the entire band was involved.
<br>
<br>
<br>There is a relentless energy behind the surface lethargy of the tempo. It 
<br>must be that basic human drive to persevere in the face of adversity which 
<br>comes through - that part of us that keeps trying no matter how many times 
<br>we run smack into the wall. What is it about the human heart that yearns so 
<br>for love despite all the pain it brings?
<br>
<br>The songs are very melodic and the harmonies are sublime. The voices of Ian 
<br>and Liz blend, build and dance together in the most enchanting ways. 
<br>Traditional instrumentation includes acoustic guitar, mandolin, banjo, 
<br>fiddle and bass. These are augmented by a haunting pedal steel, electric 
<br>guitar, B3 and C2 organ, piano, accordion, and drums.
<br>
<br>Several elements are particularly outstanding.
<br>
<br>Multi-instrumentalist and lead vocalist Ian Parks has a singing voice that 
<br>just drips lonely anguish. Ian also produced and engineered the CD and I 
<br>suspect wrote most of the lyrics and melodies.
<br>
<br>Whether singing lead or harmony, the vocals of Liz Green convey feeling and 
<br>poignancy in a warm husky tone. For my money she far surpasses all those 
<br>"names" in the music scene today who have garnered such praise. Achingly 
<br>beautiful, her notes climb and fall, they embody strength and a delicacy 
<br>that is fundamental to woman.
<br>
<br>Not since the heyday of The Band do I recall the B3 organ being used as 
<br>effectively to underscore roots music as Charley Rowan does here. Charley 
<br>has the delicate touch necessary to support, but never overshadow the music.

The Duchess of Hazard, the band's second outing, might as well be its first; following the release of 2001's overlooked Sweet Country Melodies [sic], singer-songwriter Ian Parks disbanded the group (then based in San Francisco) and relocated to Seattle to meet up with longtime friend Liz Green.  The two quickly discovered a vocal chemistry in the vein of Gram and Emmylou.  Soon after, armed with a stunning harmony singer and a new batch of songs, Parks cleaned the slate and reformed An American Starlet.
<br>
<br>This is an already solid band with plenty of time to grow.  Parks has a knack for commanding space and arrangement that suits his songs of longing, alcohol and redemption, while Green's singing complements and gives flesh.
<br>
<br>Over a weeping pedal steel and sparse mandolin accompaniment, the opening title track tells the tale of a lifelong crush that always leads to heartbreak.  The following track, "Starstruck Brother", is a head-bobbing number with a melody indelible enough to linger hours after the album's close.  The standout is the Parks-penned "Half a Heart", which finds Green taking the lead and delivering a performance strong enough to calm the wildest honky-tonk.

<br>Seattle is proving itself to be one sweet hotbed of smoldering and heartsore alt-country.  The first exhibit is of course No Depression poster girl Jesse Sykes and her band the Sweet Hereafter, led by ex-Whiskeytown guitarist Phil Wandscher.  Their 2002 album, Reckless Burning, now available on the hip indie label Barsuk, ought not to be missed.  A second piece of strong evidence of the scene�s vibrancy is the group An American Starlet and their self-released second album, The Duchess of Hazard.  This dolorous, languorous masterpiece presents a bleak relational landscape, but engages even the optimistic listener with its strong lyrical and melodic hooks.  The vocal interplay between stringman Ian Parks, the group�s main singer, and harmonizer Liz Green, is a real joy.   Mentioning only a few of the CD�s highlights � the mandolin-led title track, whose first couplet, �The greatest love that I have ever known/Has just broke my poor heart again,� sets the emotional tone; the anthemic rocker �Starstruck Brother;� the bluesy B-3/electric piano workout, �Suitcase for a Heart;� the Green-sung country weeper �Half a Heart,� with its nice pedal steel � hardly does the CD justice.  Not just a harsh mistress, The Duchess Of Hazard deserves � and rewards � repeated listening sessions.

Songwriter Ian Parks handles a fair amount of the singing, but it's the inclusion of vocalist Liz Green that really adds a haunting element with great harmonies - not to mention the duets and her solo numbers, too. They fare well with material that suits the late night honky-tonk (the pedal steel swept "Half A Heart"), or the brooding urban nightclub (the Hammond organ and electric guitar-fueled "Queen Elizabeth"). Mostly, they craft the perfect soundtrack for the brokenhearted and lovelorn.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><div class="heading">Reviews for Sweet Country Lullabies...</div><table width="640" cellpadding="3" class="frame"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><div class="boxhead">John Clarkson for Pennyblack Music</div><div></div><i>'Sweet Country Lullabies...' is one of the unsung and understated masterpieces of the year...a challenging, powerful and rewarding experience.</i><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">document.write("  <span class=\"seeMore\" style=\"display: inline;\" id=\"more2\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"javascript:unhide('press2');hide('more2');return false;\">See more...</a></span>")

The debut CD by An American Starlet is at one level very much a country album. Much of it also sounds very sweet. A few of its tracks could also be described as lullabies, but this name only paints a partial picture of an album , that is both bleak and majestic and which has been influenced as much as by fifties rock 'n' roll, sixties folk and nineties grunge as it has been by roots music. Ian Parks, the group's songwriter and principal member, comes from the same school of country and hard knocks as Ryan Adams and Gram Parsons, but his music has an essentially timeless feel and he has been equally inspired by Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan and Kurt Cobain.
<br>
<br>Parks has been one of the leading players on the San Francisco independent music scene for a decade. He first came to prominence with the Rosemarys, who formed in 1991, and , influenced by British space rock bands such as My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive, put out their first album 'Providence' on a local independent label Continuum Records in 1992.
<br>
<br>The album did well on college radio and the Rosemarys, starting to attract the interest of the majors, signed at the end of that year to Fox, a fledgling label which was owned by Rupert Murdoch under the canopy of the film company, Twentieth Century Fox. The band released a second album 'The Rosemarys', but with their deal with Fox deal turning sour, broke up to reform with a new singer under a new name, the Magnetic, in 1994. The Magnetic released a single album 'The Power of the Thomas', and, again running into difficulties with their next record label Facility Records, split up shortly afterwards.
<br>
<br>After the collapse of the Magnetic, a disillusioned Parks abandoned the music business all together for a few years, but eventually began recording again initially under the moniker of Starlet. When he found out that there was a Swedish band with the same name, he changed his new group's name to An American Starlet.
<br>
<br>'Sweet Country Lullabies...' was recorded over an eight month period in the band's practice room, and has been released on Parks' own Starlet label. Parks, who both engineered and produced 'Sweet Country Lullabies..." , sings and also plays guitar, mandolin, fiddle, dobro, banjo and bass. The band has a floating membership and the album was recorded on an "ad hoc" basis, with whoever was available. All of An American Starlet's regular live group, Patrick Harte (drums), Scott Powers (bass), Scott Appleton (Pedal Steel) and Jared Matt Greenberg (Bass, Organ, Melotron and Wurlitzer Piano), however, make appearances, and Noah Appleton (Additional drums), Dominic Fasso (Organ), David Fox (Upright Bass) and Sophia Campbell and Maria Keagle (Starlet Vocals) are also too present.
<br>
<br>It is Keagle, a former member of the Brian Jonestown Massacre and now the frontwoman in her own group, Smallstone, who takes lead vocals on the opening number 'Sweet Country Lullaby'. The tune is soft and lilting, reflective and slow and starts simply with just the sound of a stylus hitting the record and then Parks' meandering guitar kicking in, but gradually builds in complexity as more instruments, drums, pedal steel and a warbling organ, are all added. Keagle's vocals are breathless and dreamy, yet are inflicted also with an underlying darkness. "He kissed me but I was just dreaming" she breezes. "So I'm gonna go to bed and rest my weary head/And make a wish I never wake up again."
<br>
<br>This aura of darkness stems throughout much of the rest of the album as well. The rugged-voiced Parks takes over lead vocals from the second song 'Wait' onwards. 'Wait' begins with the ricocheting, seesawing sound of a fiddle, and again slowly winding other instrumentation , further guitar and drums, into its mix, has a similar sense of desperation. "Would you mind if I was just to break down and cry ?/Even if I never told you why" Parks rasps mournfully, trying to hang together with a lover, but lacking the words and the means to do so. 'Simple Sad Song', the next song, meanwhile bounces little flurrying, rattling gusts of banjo against a swirling backdrop of both piano and guitar, and captures Parks' bedsit anguish after a relationship has collapsed and he listens to records that he once enjoyed listening to with his lover alone .
<br>
<br>While the first three songs have a country sound, 'Sweet Country Lullabies..." by its fourth track starts to change flavour. 'Know It Was Better', which features Parks alone on its guitar, is a sixties style protest song in the manner of Bob Dylan before he went electric, while the enigmatic and again acoustic 'Men of the Sea', which features Keagle and Parks on joint vocals, is reminiscent with its floating, ethereal vocal harmonies of both early Fairport Convention and Joni Mitchell, The transformation is completed by the sixth song, 'She's a Star', a grunge-induced number which has a souped, gloriously sludgy acoustic sound and bringing back memories of the 'Nirvana Unplugged' set, finds Parks intoxicated with love and bordering on the dangerous and obsessive. "If she's a star/I am the sky" he reflects. "If she's the truth/I am the lie/If she's repentance/I will pay/if she is whisky/Stay drunk all day."
<br>
<br>On the seventh song 'Love With You', the band swop genres again. A exercise in rock 'n' roll, it involves lots of snapping fingers, has a rumbling Eddie Cochran style three chord riff and a good-humoured boy-falls-in-love-with-girl lyric, all of which make it by far the lightest song on the album. 'Why Are You Alone Tonight ?' is, meanwhile, An American Starlet's 'Are You Lonesome Tonight ?' A tender, wistful ballad, it is the sort of song the young Elvis or a vulnerable boy crooner such as Marty Wilde or Terry Dene might have made in the late fifties or early sixties.
<br>
<br>As the album moves towards its conclusion, it develops a country sound again. The epic ninth track 'Softly Tomorrow' clocks in at over six minutes, and, about a relationship winding to an end, begins with Parks singing softly against the gentle backdrop of an organ, but then builds up tempo again to become another full band number. The tenth and penultimate number 'Waltzing to 12' is also about the collapse of a romance, this time with a younger woman and uses a mandolin as its main instrument. "She was everything I wanted to be/Young and wild and still free " Parks confesses, summing up in a moment everything that has gone wrong with the love affair. The last track 'Plan Field Station' meanwhile is an instrumental. A jigging barn dance waltz, it is the most traditionally country of all the songs on the album and brings the album to a frenzied, breathless and affirmative conclusion.
<br>
<br>Not at all then, other than its first and last moments what might have been expected, 'Sweet Country Lullabies...' is one of the unsung and understated masterpieces of the year. Recorded on no budget, but with the time, energy and sheer will to get it right, it is a challenging, powerful and rewarding experience. Enterprising, dynamic and far more versatile than its ironic choice of name implies, it is one of the small alternative rock releases of the year and deserves an enthusiastic audience.

To write them off as a No Depression or Alt Country act would be a shortcut to cerebral activity. Their sound is a droning, stony, transmundane and varied collection of California Country Rock songs and outer-space sea shanties that seem to inadvertantly dip into the rich tapestry of West Coast cosmic American music. The male/female harmonies crystallize over cerulean drops of musical notes bent lightly from a skilled master of the pedal steel. Where most young Americana bands encompass a tired mixture of the Replacements with the Burritos, Starlet are more akin to playing what seems to come naturally, without any of the derivitive and overdone y'allternative twang found in almost every Midwestern suburban town. Perfect music for tokin' under the stars of the Cap Rock desert sky.

<br>Raw, yet polished, alterna-hick finds its charisma in Parks� musicality, and gritty lead vocals. Guitars, dobros, mandolins, and banjos are treated royally in the nimble hands of Parks. He also enlists other Bay area talents (many from his former bands) to season the production with their musical prowess. Jared Matt Greenberg (Charles Atlas) aptly handles the organs and pianos. Sophia Campbell and Mara Keagle (Smallstone, Brian Jonestown Massacre) provide Patsy Cline-like vocals. Veteran musicians Patrick Harte, Peter Weldon, Scott Powers, Scott and Noah Appleton, Dominic Fasso, and David Fox collectively add finesse with upright bass, pedal steel, and drums.

Some folks buy records knowing what they want to hear before they've peeled the cellophane and pressed the play button. They know an artist, they expect a certain sound, they expect a certain emotional satisfaction from the music. I'm not any different, especially with artists I'm already familiar with. But I also have a side that loves CDs that surprise, that present sounds that are completely unexpected, that if I don't pay strict attention to, I don't get (and the more records I preview and review, the stronger this impulse gets). "Sweet Country Lullabies" from San Francisco's An American Starlet really snuck up on me.
<br>
<br>Initially, with a somewhat pretentious sounding band name like An American Starlet, I didn't really have high hopes. I figured this band was either taking itself way too seriously for a first CD or they had a twisted, maybe even self-deprecating sense of humor, which I saw as a plus. I'd seen the CD spammed on Americana music websites and, as with all processed meat byproducts, it was hyped to be the greatest thing for human consumption since canned ham leavings were pressed into a jello mold and packed in a square can with a key opener on top. I was thinking another alt-country or roots knock off, same ole same ole. Not hardly!
<br>
<br>Oh, there is a Son Volt/Wilco thing at work on some of the songs, if we need an easily understandable highway sign to come to grips with the direction "Sweet Country Lullabies" goes in. But that only scratches the surface because there are also tunes like 'Men of the Sea' that would be at home on a Fairport Convention album circa 1968, and there are others that would be comfortable nestled in beside Traffic's 'John Barleycorn.' But (cover your eyes, country fans), what a lot of this music reminds me of is Nirvana unplugged and on a country tangent. With Steve Earle sitting in on mandolin and Jimmy Day on steel guitar.
<br>
<br>To boil it down into something small and easily understandable, what really got me about this record was that this little band was doing country songs (listen, hear the steel guitars, the mandolins, the fiddle, hear the lyrics?) but there is something urban and modern about the guitar work and vocals, something almost grungy. The vocals, which are soft and angst-filled, sensitive, earnest, at times bring Velvet Underground and Nico to mind. At other times, the vocals have that raspy Jeff Tweedy somnolence. But even these descriptions don't cover all the bases with An American Starlet, as they incorporate elements of soul music and even bluegrass into their rich musical textures.
<br>
<br>Upon closer listening, I could even hear a church organ filling in gaps unobtrusively in the background. With the instrumentation and pace, it seemed like it should have all been clashing and completely incongruous, a garish, cheap patchwork coat, but it was working and working very well. And just when I began to get my brain around this strange brew coming out of the speakers, An American Starlet switched gears and, with no instrumentation except guitar, handclaps and finger snaps, came at me with a lilting, echoing, rockabilly hubba-hubba Brit rock groover (remember 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love'?) that would make Dave Edmunds jealous. By this point I was feeling like Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid when that unrelenting posse was after them: my cynical inner critic-self was screaming WHO ARE THESE GUYS?
<br>
<br>According to the press pack, "An American Starlet" is the combination of the remnants of two San Francisco bands, The Rosemarys (who had a major label deal go sour) and The Magnetic. But the moving force behind Starlet is one Ian Parks, engineer, songwriter, singer, guitarist, who also plays mandolin, fiddle, dobro, banjo, and bass. He is ably joined by Jared Matt Greenberg on bass, organ, melotron, and Wurlitzer piano, Scott Appleton on pedal steel, Peter Weldon on acoustic guitar, Noah Appleton and Patrick Harte on drums (although half the tracks are drumless). Parks, Greenberg, Weldon, Scott Appleton, Powers and Harte comprise the live, stage version of Starlet. When Parks isn't singing in that Kurt Cobain/Mic Harrison/Jeff Tweedy voice of his, Mara Keagle and Sophia Campbell do some splendid, airy vocal work.
<br>
<br>"Sweet Country Lullabies" was recorded "on no budget" at the Starlet's practice space in San Francisco. The sound quality is surprisingly bright and crisp, and it doesn't take much listening to realize you aren't dealing with amateurs. You don't need a lyric sheet to know what is being sung. And young Mr. Parks has quite a fine way with lyrics and a well-tuned understanding of how to present and project them.
<br>
<br>'Sweet Country Lullaby' opens with a loose, almost haphazardly simple electric guitar (which my wife said reminded her of Hendrix) coupled with some delicate steel guitar work that sets a stony, 'Sleep Walk' tone to the cut. Mara Keagle's breathless, little-girl, wish-upon-a-star vocals and the layering of guitars by Parks make the piece. It is a simple piece, and the steel guitar solo and the pace make the song identifiably country, but Parks' expert layering of instruments takes what begins as a simple strum and turns it into a grand, complex production, all the more amazing because it is done totally without any manic element or electronic gadgetry. It'll never make TNN or the Grand Ole Opry or even commercial country radio, but this is adult country music at its best. Deep stuff.
<br>
<br>He kissed me but I was just dreaming
<br>So I'm gonna go to bed and rest my weary head
<br>And make a wish I never wake up again
<br>'Cause I missed him when I woke up this morning
<br>So I'm gonna go to sleep and pray the lord my soul to keep
<br>These dreams sweet in my head
<br>
<br>Parks' sawing fiddle on 'Wait' kicks the tune off with a distinct alt-country No Depression feel, and his wistful, sorrowful voice only adds to the effect. This kid can sing. And even though he says he doesn't write down most of his lyrics (there's no copyright information or song credits, etc. on the package), he can certainly compose a catchy song.
<br>
<br>Would you mind if I was just to sit down awhile
<br>Maybe have a seat and slowly drink down your smile
<br>You know I'd never want to make you feel used
<br>But what's a lonely boy to do
<br>
<br>How long is too long when there's no tomorrow
<br>How long should I sit and wait in the dark
<br>While you make unconceivable words so believable
<br>How long should I wait to hold you tonight
<br>
<br>Parks' songwriting skills are further demonstrated with the ethereal but grungy love song, 'She's a Star.' This is Nirvana unplugged and Parks' guitar work and vocals are spot on again.
<br>
<br>If she's a star
<br>I am her sky
<br>If she's the answer
<br>I'm asking why
<br>If she's religion
<br>Then I will pray
<br>If she's forever
<br>I am a day
<br>
<br>If she's a star
<br>I am the sky
<br>If she's the truth
<br>I am the lie
<br>If she's repentance
<br>Then I will pay
<br>If she is whisky
<br>Stay drunk all day
<br>
<br>It's lyrics like these, coupled with instrumental prowess that make "Sweet Country Lullabies" from An American Starlet a thinking person's recording. It is one of those moody records, the kind you like to play at three in the morning when you can't sleep or you aren't in the mood for something bouncy and light. It is unfortunate that the band doesn't have a larger promotional budget (although they are planning to run ads in No Depression magazine) to get the word out to the public and even more importantly to radio, because this CD is a real keeper and deserves much more attention that it is probably going to get. Judging from the talent exhibited on "Sweet Country Lullabies," we will be hearing more from Ian Parks and An American Starlet no matter how successful their debut CD is, because it is obvious that music is what they do.

Life in the old beast yet. That beast being alt.country (though whether this is truly alt. or just good, plain, old time is something I can leave for you to debate and waste an evening over.) With a pleasing mix of acoustic instruments and a leisurely pace An American Starlet immediately demands attention. So it comes as a bit of a surprise when the next song is sung by a man, Ian Parks (the brains, guitar, voice, banjo, mandolin etc. behind �AAS�) but when you hear his voice you won�t be sorry. Slurred and gritty, it�s a voice born to sing about loss, decay and bourbon bottles - and that�s what he sings about. Simple Sad Song is just that, sung by Parks in a voice filled with the gravitas and pathos of Jay Farrar. And that wouldn�t be a bad comparison except that Parks has more than one melody, more than four chords, in his bag of tricks. The delicate interplay of organ and banjo on this track is one of those moments that force you to get off the sofa, turn up the volume and luxuriate. Know It Was Better is as slow and sad as a funeral procession in the rain, conveying the kind of urgency and passion which Redstar Belgrade so often find. Best of all, She�s A Star with its overlapped vocals and keening strings, has the feel of early Band, like something off their timeless second album, Parks� phrasing spookily reminiscent of Richard Manuel�s. The fingersnapping, ducktailed 50�s swing and shuffle of Love With You adds some welcome breadth while the epic Softly Tomorrow is gently touching (though a tad overlong). If there are problems, they�re ones normally associated with a debut - some of the recording sounds flat and the songwriting tends towards the one dimensional - especially during the latter stages of the album - but in what there is, there�s promise that �AAS� might become a band to keep an eye on, effortlessly mining a seam of melancholy country, unimpeded by clich� or tack, with something like real soul behind the surface. The gently rolling instrumental closer, Plain Field Station, is perhaps a taste of things to come, all sweetly swooping fiddles and spiky banjos, filled with verve and excitement.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><table width="640" cellpadding="3" class="frame"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><div class="boxhead"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050314000142/http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/a/americanstarlet-sweet.html">Carolyn Kellogg for popmatters.com</a></div><div></div><i>The production, for the most part, is unimpeachable, and the instrumentation is lush with talent.</i><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">document.write("  <span class=\"seeMore\" style=\"display: inline;\" id=\"more12\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"javascript:unhide('press12');hide('more12');return false;\">See more...</a></span>")

Alt-country, you're thinking, and the fiddle and organ would prove you right. Mara Keagle's vocals strike right to the bone on the opening (eponymous) track of this debut CD from San Francisco's An American Starlet. 
<br>
<br>Quite nice for a collective that actually is more of just a guy. Humility is a staple of the alt-country diet, and definitely is in this case -- you've got to look hard through the credits list to figure out who performers on most of the tracks. Way down the list (ninth out of 13, to be exact) Ian Parks appears: he's the Starlet man. He does more than just play guitars and write songs: he's also responsible for vocals, mandolin, fiddle, dobro, banjo, bass, and producing. 
<br>
<br>Over the course of eight months Parks gathered his friends in his performance/recording studio and put together this CD, writing and recording and then releasing it on his own. That in itself is quite an accomplishment, and the standout tracks make it more than worth his effort. 
<br>
<br>On "Why Are You Alone Tonight", Parks sings solo, with a wavering mellotron, that steel guitar, and low-key drums. Simple and lilting, the songwriting stands out -- no remarkable vocabulary words but a simple and rhythmic stepping melody that evokes the kind of songs Patsy Cline used to record. Similarly, bare acoustic instrumentation on "Waltzing to 12" offsets melancholy lyrics in the most flattering light. 
<br>
<br>Yet on a handful of the tracks, the country gets rock-ified -- to its detriment. Or maybe all the songs began as rock and only the lucky ones got stripped down to raw sinew. Parks, a veteran of two major-label rock bands, has admitted that the demise of his second band, the Magnetics, was due to "trying to tailor ourselves to what we thought would be embraced by the record industry." A ready-for-radio, smoothed-out rock sound makes appearances here, on "She's a Star", "Softly Tomorrow", and "Know It Was Better"; it sounds as though Parks has not yet completely ditched his bad habits. Some would probably not consider these smooth edges bad, but in contrast to a gem like "Sweet Country Lullabies", the rock songs do fade to pale. 
<br>
<br>Yet for each time Parks stumbles, there's another song with a gentle backing vocal or weaving mandolin line to set the CD back on track. The production, for the most part, is unimpeachable, and the instrumentation is lush with talent. The lyrics occasionally get short shrift, but when they're on, they glide into their songs' melodies like butter. 
<br>
<br>Chalk the weak spots up to self-editing (even the most brilliant artists need a cold cruel hand to cut the chaff), or to bad striving-for-success habits. It could even be that all Ian Parks needs is to commit a handful of his best players to really becoming a band, and that their give-and-take would create a more solid whole. For pete's sake, he should at least wrangle Nora Keagle (smallstone) into appearing on more than just two tracks next time around -- in her he's found a terrific interpreter. 
<br>
<br>With a bit of luck the next An American Starlet record will prove the great songs here no fluke.

<br>
<br>The triple power bill of Radio Nationals, Sanford Arms, and An American Starlet at the Tractor on May 15 should prove just how vital and elastic the somewhat lame term alt-country has become. Headliners Radio Nationals offer the more rocking aspects of the country-rock hyphenated genre. Their driving, brawny songs work wonders in a live setting, where their bar-band looseness and perfect songcraft combine for raucous shows that always get the crowds excited. Sanford Arms grow more tangled, atmospheric, and interesting with every year. Their latest album, The Twilight Era, is full of the offhanded poetic grace that has always been evident but has recently come into full bloom. Their songs defy easy categorization and are all the stronger for the dodge. An American Starlet delivered one of the most satisfying albums of the year with The Duchess of Hazard. There is no easily apparent set of influences with the band but the interplay of singers Ian Parks and Liz Green pulls fondly (but not slavishly) at memories of Emmylou Harris and Gram Parsons' collaborations. Obviously, withstanding that kind of comparison is difficult, but they really do rise to the challenge. The keening telepathy between the pair's voices lends to the songs an understated heartbreak that is all the more powerful for its restraint.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><table width="640" cellpadding="3" class="frame"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><div class="boxhead">Bill Groll for 3rd Coast Magazine</div><div></div><i>New &amp; Wonderful</i><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">document.write("  <span class=\"seeMore\" style=\"display: inline;\" id=\"more24\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"javascript:unhide('press24');hide('more24');return false;\">See more...</a></span>")

I've seen AAS before, and their melancholic twang amazed me even while I was in a giddy, social, love-is-grand type of mood. On this particular night, love seemed not-so-grand for me, and even though they were playing the same notes and singing the same lyrics, I saw an entirely different AAS. They took the stage and took part of my heart with them.
<br>
<br>I can't think of a more ideal band for a heartache. The stage chemistry between the two vocalists Ian Parks and Liz Green inter-twined to form the most heartbreaking, stomach-wrenching set I have seen in months. The passion and pain were blaringly obvious in both Liz's vocals and in Ian's facial expressions and in the lyrics.
<br>
<br>I would have started tearing up if it wasn't for the drunken jester in the front row, tripping over imaginary kinks in the imaginary carpet on the floor. As drunks sense moments of vulnerability, he of course chose me out of the crowd to talk to. After a too close for comfort slurred one-way conversation, I finally answered the only question I could translate, "Whassyer name anyways?" I told him my name was Suzie. Then I ran away.
<br>
<br>But I couldn't run far enough. Liz had a minor altercation with the Drunken Jester {DJ} too. While facing the crowd front and center during their set, he tripped on nothing and fell back into the stage monitor which, in turn, pushed onto Liz. Liz was a champ and started smiling, glancing at her friends in the audience with a, "What the hell is up with this guy" look. By this time, DJ had successfully pulled all eyes off of the stage and onto him. He chose this as the opportune time to talk to � guess who? � me {well, Suzie}. He pointed, said quite loudly "SUUUUUU-ZEEEE" and stumbled over to chat. Let me tell you, it's hard to be imaginary when everyone in the bar is looking at you.
<br>
<br>I really hate to distract from my lushing about An American Starlet, because they deserve all of the lushing I have to give {lushing = gushing + lusting}. All I wanted to do was absorb every harmony I could squeeze out of Liz and Ian. Luckily, I have their lastest CD "The Duchess of Hazard" and I listened to it five times in succession the next day.
<br>
<br>I'm even more in love with them now. I just wish they would play out more! Next time you feel your heart shattering inside of your chest, go to an American Starlet show and let Ian put your pain onto the stage and tell you how to numb it with whiskey. Don't believe me? Listen to the ultra-freaking-awesome {sorry, I'm at a loss for appropriate adjectives} song, Half a Heart or "Maker's Lament" {which isn't on the website; sorry, buy the album here you cheapskate}, and tell me that's not the most heart-wrenching song you've ever heard. Actually, if you know of a more heart wrenching song, don't tell me about it. I don't think I'll be able to handle it.</div></td></tr></tbody></table><table width="640" cellpadding="3" class="frame"><tbody><tr valign="top"><td><div class="boxhead"><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050314000142/http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/pop/155825_club09.html">Tizzy Asher for Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a></div><div></div><i>Fans of Emmylou Harris and Gram Parsons will appreciate the taut intensity of vocalists Ian Parks and Liz Green...</i><script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">document.write("  <span class=\"seeMore\" style=\"display: inline;\" id=\"more17\"><a href=\"#\" onclick=\"javascript:unhide('press17');hide('more17');return false;\">See more...</a></span>")

An American Starlet seamlessly blends these two genres together and creates songs enjoyed by hipsters, country folk and everyone in between. An American Starlet was formed (under the original name, Starlet) by Ian Parks in San Francisco. He later moved to Seattle and reconstructed the band.
<br>
<br>The Tractor Tavern created a perfect backdrop for this band. With the exception of Liz (the female vocalist) and the organ player, all band members were seated during the performance. Frontman and multi-instrumentalist, Ian Parks, also treats his voice as a multi-faceted instrument. Every waver and harmony was sweetly inserted with acute sensitivity. The extravagantly lush harmonies and the pain-filled lyrics triggered me to buy Ian a shot of Wild Turkey, pat him on the back and reassure him that everything was going to be okay; but I was too mesmerized by his dramatic, slow thrashing. I haven't seen seated movement that uncontained since I had dinner at a pizza joint with an eight year old hopped up on Cadbury Eggs and Coca cola.
<br>
<br>The years of experience and musical passion are apparent in every song. This combined group of people are not mere musicians, they are professionals. They aren't puking out cute little songs, they're creating masterpieces. So many instruments were incorporated into each song, yet the sound was surprisingly stripped down and simple; simply beautiful with a touch of sweet sorrow.
<br>
<br>I've decided this band is going to be my new first date litmus test. I will nonchalantly insert this CD into my player while driving with a potential life long companion. If aforementioned date shows any variety of distain for the music, I will pull over, let date out of my car and move along to someone who appreciates a little heartbreaking country now and again.

Ian Parks, who claims the world’s “worst luck” with women, understands the catharsis of music. “Songwriting is the ultimate therapy,” he says. Out of this came the fist album Sweet Country Lullabies, which contains 11 songs that are Ian’s first attempt to put pain to paper in the country genre. The band at this point is actually a temporary collection of friends. Nonetheless, the style and tenor that becomes fully developed later is very apparent. 
<br>
<br>The band name was originally Starlet, as in a minor star twinkling in the firmament. After registering the name StarletsWeb.com, Ina discovered a Swedish group named Starlet. He was stumped until coming up with the modifier. Figuring The American Starlet was too pretentious, he settled on An American Starlet.
<br>
<br>Ian felt San Francisco wasn’t a nurturing environment for his poignant country music. He moved to Seattle, where there were friends and family. This was the seminal event for the present band. Ian rented a room in the house of his friend Liz Green. After hearing her sing, he realized this was the singing partner he needed. When Liz agreed, Ian began looking for additional musicians by placing ads in the local paper and on the Internet. He quickly received calls from drummer Stefan LaMotte and bassist Todd Gehman. Developing an immediate rapport with both, he invited them to join the band. Ian met Charley Rowan at a party and another similar soul was found.
<br>
<br>It is the “vibe” of these particular people coming together that has created the unique and passionate sound of their release, The Duchess of Hazard. Ian brought lyrics and a melody to rehearsal and, in a collaborative effort, the song was formed and finished by the ensemble. Ian insists it is the musicians’ “natural instincts” that ultimately write the music.
<br>
<br>The Duchess of Hazard is a modern masterpiece of the country roots genre. Its unique blend of country and folk music is at once slow and energetic, young and old, soft and passionate. There is a relentless energy behind the surface lethargy of the tempo. It is the basic human drive to persevere in the face of adversity which comes through – that part of us that keeps trying no matter how many times we fail.
<br>
<br>The songs are melodic and the harmonies sublime. The voices of Ian and Liz blend, build and dance together. Ian’s voice just drips lonely anguish. Liz’s conveys feeling and poignancy in a warm husky tone. Traditional instrumentation includes acoustic guitar, mandolin, banjo, fiddle and bass. These are augmented by a haunting pedal steel, electric guitar, B3 and C2 organ, piano, accordion and drums.

<br>I have a bad habit of getting involved with not the best women in the world, so I thought the Duchess of Hazard was a nice, plain phrase to kind of describe some of my relationships. A lot of the songs on the record are about that subject in particular.
<br>
<br>I thought that it was more fitting title for the whole record, whereas before, when I had originally thought about the second record, I was thinking more about a record about redemption through fucking up or whatever, and having your mistakes lead you to a better place. While that�s what �The Dirt� is about, most of the songs on there are inspired by these so-called Duchesses of Hazard.
<br>
<br>PB : The title song, �The Duchess of Hazard�, is about �the greatest love I have ever known�. Nearly all the songs on the album are character-based and could be about described about being about the greatest love in one form or another, whether it is, romantic, sexual or spiritual. It is the first track on the album. Do you see that song as providing as a prelude to the rest of the album ?
<br>
<br>IP : Yes ! That�s why I wanted it to be first. It is like the preface. When I say �the greatest love I have ever known�, I don�t really think it speaks of anyone in particular, but more of this idea of love that I have and my maybe unrealistic ideas of what love is supposed to be.
<br>
<br>PB : Several critics have picked up on the fact that the album is �a grower�, and needs to be listened to several times to be fully appreciated. Why do you think that they have said that?
<br>
<br>LG : A lot of heavy-hitting, or emotionally-charged albums often find themselves characterised, as �growers�. You have to sometimes step back from them, before you can listen to them a little more and start to get the idea of what is really going on. The lyrics on �The Duchess of Hazard� are very potent, so you have absorb them over a period of time.
<br>
<br>IP : I guess it�s like blue cheese. It�s definitely not for everybody (Laughs !)
<br>
<br>PB : It�s a very well sequenced album, with a natural beginning, a middle and conclusion.Did you spend a lot of time thinking about which track would go where?
<br>
<br>IP : Yeah, we did. It was something we discussed it a lot. We tried different sequences. Since I did it all on a Macintosh, we were able to throw it into i-tunes and it was really easy to change the sequences. I burned off various versions of the album on CDR for the other members of the band.
<br>
<br>Liz and I combined together to come up with the final sequence. We gave it to other people in the group and we gave them time to decide whether or not they liked it and they all came back and said that they felt that it flowed well.
<br>
<br>I wanted the album to have a kinetic energy to it. I wanted to space the slow songs and intermittingly put in the quicker ones, so that we could bring people listening to the record up and then down and then up again.
<br>
<br>PB : Your first album �Sweet Country Lullabies...� was the work of what you have described as �a musical family� with members coming and going depending on when they were available. This second album involves performances from a regular band. How do you think that affected the recording and changed it from the first one?
<br>
<br>IP : It was much better, because I had people who weren�t doing me favours. They had a vested interest in the songs. I didn�t write anyone�s parts for them. I wanted everybody to feel like it was their record, and not just mine, and everybody had their input and their say.
<br>
<br>We had practiced so much that most of what you hear is cut live. Rhythmically it just feels much more solid. On some of the cuts on �Lullabies�, I listen to them now and I can hear the groove getting out of the swing or something similar because I got my friend to come in and play drums for the afternoon or whatever. He wasn�t getting paid, and I got the best I could out of his time, whereas this time everybody wanted to make the best record we possibly could.
<br>
<br>PB : You planned originally to involve a lot of people who had been in San Francisco with you and who had worked on �Sweet Country Lullabies�, but in fact only ended up using two of them, Scott Appleton and Jared Matt Greenberg. Who is Scott Appleton?
<br>
<br>IP : He�s a pedal steel player. He is still based in San Francisco, but comes up here from time to time just to do shows with us. The way I met him was through the Magnetic. His son was our drummer.
<br>
<br>When we were first called Starlet, before we changed the name, he was one of the first people I asked to be a member of the band because I really wanted a pedal steel player. For this album I asked him he would feel about coming up to Seattle to do some tracking, and it also happened to coincide with a show we were playing with Jesse Sykes. He came up and did the show and spent five days cutting tracks. He is a really great guy.
<br>
<br>PB : Jared Matt Greenberg was in both the Rosemarys and the Magnetic with you, and made large contributions to the last album. He appears playing piano on just two tracks this time, �When We Sleep� and �When I Sleep�.
<br>
<br>IP : It�s actually the same song, and it�s even the same piano take. When I mixed �When We Sleep� I didn�t feel that Jared Matt�s piano featured enough. I really wanted everyone to hear what an amazing piano part it was and so I just tried removing all the other parts except for the piano and my voice. I really liked the way it sounded and so I put that version of the track on the album as well and called it �When I Sleep�.
<br>
<br>PB : You said in the past that you couldn�t conceive of doing an album without Jared Matt.
<br>
<br>IP : I would still say that to this day. He�s been my best friend for almost twenty years now.
<br>
<br>PB : What have the been the advantages and disadvantages of moving to Seattle from San Francisco for you both personally and musically?
<br>
<br>IP : I can�t really think of any disadvantages except for maybe a few girls I met (Laughs !). Musically Seattle is a much better place to be for any kind of musician. It has a very supportive local music audience. We have just played a bill which featured us, the Believers and Christie McWilson at a place called the Triple Door. It is a big venue and tickets were $10 and this was three local bands and it sold out. That kind of thing doesn�t happen in San Francisco. We played in San Francisco for two years to the same 25 people.
<br>
<br>PB: Liz, you and Ian have been friends for a while, and he actually roomed in your house for a time when he first moved to Seattle. There�s an interesting story about how Ian enlisted you into the band after hearing you sing in a karaoke bar. What is the story there?
<br>
<br>LG : Ian had moved into town and it was his first night. We went up to a karaoke bar for somebody�s birthday and I had enough whisky in me to have a wild hair in my butt (Laughs !) and decided to get up to do �Bohemian Rhapsody� and Ian was kind enough afterwards to ask me to be in his band.
<br>
<br>IP : I was blown away that she could sing it. She channelled Freddie Mercury like you would not believe.
<br>
<br>PB : Had you any previous experience of singing in bands prior to this?
<br>
<br>LG : The only experiences I had of being on stage as an adult were at cover and karoake nights.
<br>
<br>PB : The other members of the band were all recruited from classified ads. Who are they?
<br>
<br>IP : The Gods of Music must have been with me or something. I came into town and I placed an ad in a local magazine called �The Stranger� and the second phone call I got was from this guy Stefan LaMotte who became our drummer, and who happens to be the best drummer I have ever played with in my life.
<br>
<br>There�s another listings magazine called �Seattle Twang� and I also placed an ad in that and Todd Gehman, our bass player, answered through that. I had already asked a friend of mine to play bass, so I asked Todd �Do you play anything else?� and he said �Well, I play a little piano� and I said �If you play the piano, I bet you can play the organ�, so he initially joined the band as our organ player.
<br>
<br>Todd was in a country band called the Shiners and I went to see them, and I came away really wishing that Todd was our bass player. The guy who was playing bass, although I love him, and he�s still a good friend of mine, just wasn�t right and we had a parting of ways. After that Todd stepped in and started playing bass.
<br>
<br>The final member of the group, Charley Rowan, is our keyboard player. I met him because my brother has been a musician in Seattle for years and years. As a result of that I get invited to a lot of these music parties, where veteran musicians hang out. I met Charley at one of these and I started talking to him and asked him if he would like to come and play with us and he was into the idea.
<br>
<br>LG : He actually started out playing accordian with us.
<br>
<br>IP : That was because we started out by doing just acoustic sets. We then began doing more electric stuff, and, when we got him in on the organ as a result of that, he really started showing what an amazing key player and piano player he is.
<br>
<br>I got real fortunate this time around with the good musicians we have got. Out of every band that I have been in in my life, this one has the least amount of inner tensions. Rehearsals are always fun. For a lot of people in the band this is their first record, and everybody is really excited now that the album is out and radio stations are beginning to pick it up across the world.
<br>
<br>PB : Liz, you take lead vocals on both �The Dirt� and �Half a Heart�. What is your interpretation of both those songs ?
<br>
<br>LG : I think Ian has a lovely sensibility about human nature and the sad side of humanity. He has this amazing ability to channel emotions,. While �The Dirt� is about redemption and death, and is written from a woman�s perspective, �Half a Heart� comes from a man�s perspective, and is actually written from Ian�s perspective. On it he is lamenting not giving more to someone who deserves it, while on some of the other songs you feel that he is giving his whole heart to people who maybe don�t deserve it.
<br>
<br>PB : What is the song �Queen Elizabeth� about?
<br>
<br>IP : It�s actually an apology (laughs !) I came to this realisation one night that a lot of the really important women in my life were all called Elizabeth. There have been four of them. At the time I wrote it I was dating this girl Liz, but her name was Elizabeth, and I wasn�t very nice to her, and I felt totally shitty about it afterwards. It�s sort of my �I am sorry�. There was another woman involved, and she ended up being one of the Duchesses of Hazard.
<br>
<br>PB : �The Duchess of Hazard� took a long time to record, nearly a year, didn�t it?
<br>
<br>IP : We had four false starts. We weren�t happy with the results and ended up totally scrapping things. When we finally got the good basic tracks down it took about four months including the mixing.
<br>
<br>PB : Where was the album recorded?
<br>
<br>IP : It was recorded in several different places. There are cuts from my basement and the basement of the old house I used to live in with Liz. We did some drum tracks in a real studio in my friend Tito�s house, and we did a lot of the tracking there also. Todd also recently bought a house with a really beautiful artists� space in it, and that has proved a really good place to record in also. Jared Matt Greenberg�s piano parts were meanwhile recorded down in San Francisco in the same place that �Sweet Country Lullabies� was recorded.
<br>
<br>PB : You said when you first started out with an American Starlet that you never intended to pay for studio time again. Did you stick to that with this album ?
<br>
<br>IP : Pretty much so!  I did in fact pay Tito 300 dollars for two full days studio time, and also traded doing some engineering with him. That was only because we didn�t have a space at that time where we could all play at the same time and record, but now we do at Todd�s place and so we won�t do that again.
<br>
<br>PB : You plan to tour Europe with this album. don�t you ?
<br>
<br>LG : We�re going to try and do a tour in Europe in the late spring or summer.
<br>
<br>IP : We�d really like to get on the bills of some of the festivals there.
<br>
<br>PB : Will the the whole band going out?
<br>
<br>IP : It will definitely be the four core people. We consider the four core members to be Liz, Stefan, Todd and myself. Charlie has a family, so it�s harder for him, but if he can come it will be great. If not maybe Jared Matt will be coming with us. We feel strong enough just as the four of us to play in front of anybody, but it�s nice to hear the other sounds too, the organs, the piano and the pedal steel.
<br>
<br>PB : Do you have any other plans at the moment?
<br>
<br>IP : Yes ! We are going to do a split single with a guy named A.J. Roach who is out of San Francisco , but who is originally from Virginia. He is a really gifted singer-songwriter, and for the first time ever I am going to give up the engineering and producing rein to Tucker Martine (Seattle producer, who has worked with Jesse Sykes and Transmissionary Six, and also has his own instrumental project, Mount Analog-Ed). We�re talking about that maybe being a collectors� item. We�re also already six songs into the new album.
<br>
<br>PB : When is that liable to come out?
<br>
<br>IP : There was too much time between the other two albums The goal is to definitely have it out by the end of 2004. It is tentatively going to be called �Hit�
<br>
<br>PB : Thank you

The group, which was born out of the ashes of two other Bay Area bands, the Rosemarys and the Magnetic, is a consortium with a floating membership, but its songwriter and leader, however, is the multi-talented Ian Parks, who as well as singing and playing guitar, mandolin, fiddle, dobro, banjo and bass on 'Sweet Country Lullabies...', also engineered and produced it.
<br>
<br>Both the Rosemarys and the Magnetic had deals with their record companies which went sour, and Parks, promising himself that he would never pay to record in a studio again, made the decision to record 'Sweet Country Lullabies...' entirely in the band's own practice space. Recorded on an "ad hoc" basis with whoever was available and over an eight month period, 'Sweet Country Lullabies...'is a fluent and remarkably diverse album, which, despite its title, has been influenced as much by fifties rock 'n' roll, sixties folk and nineties grunge as it has been by roots music.
<br>
<br>As well as Parks, it also features the talents of another ten musicians. All of the members which constitute An American Starlet's regular live group,Patrick Harte (Drums), Scott Powers (Bass), Scott Appleton (Pedal steel), Peter Weldon (Acoustic guitar) and Jared Matt Greenberg (Bass, organ, melotron and Wurltizer piano), however, are all present. There are also special guest appearances from Noah Appleton (Additional drums), Dominic Fasso (Organ), David Fox (Upright Bass) and Sophia Campbell and Maria Keagle ("Starlet" vocals).
<br>
<br>Parks is in the process of moving from San Francisco to Seattle. Work has, however, already begun on An American Starlet's second album 'Dear Lord Let This Dirt Redeem Me'. The group is also starting to attract attention in Europe, and Parks is hoping to play dates overseas, possibly on his own or with some of the other band members, early next year.
<br>
<br>With three tracks of the new album already recorded, Pennyblackmusic caught with up him and Greenberg, who was also a member of the Rosemarys and the Magnetic, at this pivotal point in the group's career to talk about 'Sweet Country Lullabies...' and also the band's future direction.
<br>
<br>PB : Who were the Rosemarys and the Magnetic ? Did they record anything?
<br>
<br>IP : Well the Rosemarys were formed in '91. We recorded our first album in '92 which was released on an indie label called Continuum records. The record was called 'Providence' and did quite well at college radio, and sold around 20,000 units. This lead to us being courted by the Majors, who we were foolish enough to sign with at the end of '92. We ended up on Fox Records, Rupert Murdoch's fledgling label under the canopy of Twentieth Century Fox.This was the kiss of death. We released one album with Fox 'The Rosemarys',and then after being fucked with no end we broke up.
<br>
<br>The band was very influenced by British Space rock bands like Slowdive and My Bloody Valentine.After the demise of the Rosemarys, all of us except Tim , the singer, went on to form the Magnetic.We hooked up with a British front man named Andrew Ableson. He is the son of the big English Crooner, Frankie Vaughn, and was trying to escape his legacy by coming to the States where he might enjoy some anonymity. We were signed to 'Facility Records' almost right away,and began recording 'The Power of the Thomas', our one and only record. Some of the same demons, however, followed us from the Rosemarys and ended up splitting the band.
<br>
<br>After this I officially quit music for 2 years, but old habits die hard and I found myself recording again. Initially it was under the name 'Starlet', but after finding about a Swedish band with the same name it was changed to 'An American Starlet.'
<br>
<br>PB : Can you define what the Magnetic sounded like ? Were they another space rock band ? You say that some of the same demons followed you from the Rosemarys and broke up the band. What were those ?
<br>
<br>JM: The Magnetic was heavier on the rock than the space, but still embraced both elements. Andrew's voice was a lot more singerly and direct than Tim's wistful vocals had been.
<br>
<br>IP: As to The Magnetics' demise, the intentions behind the forming of the group were not 100% pure to begin with, so there was no way it was going to make it in the long haul. We were definitely trying to tailor ourselves to what we thought would be embraced by the record industry.
<br>
<br>PB: You've chosen to release 'Sweet Country Lullabies' on your own Starletsweb label. After your bad experiences with Fox and Facility, what do you feel are the main advantages of releasing albums by yourself ? Do you think there are any disadvantages ?
<br>
<br>IP: Well, I guess I just wanted to get something out as fast as I could. But now that I have done it once it really seems like the way to go. When we made records for other labels, it seemed like all the fun of making music just disappeared. When you are doing it for yourself, it retains a certain purity. As for disadvantages, well I wish we could get a distribution deal especially in Europe where we seem to be getting the most attention.
<br>
<br>JM: The clear advantage of putting out your own records is complete creative control, as well as control over how the group's image is marketed. We no longer have ex-frat guy label execs singing their ideas for hooky choruses into our answering machines as once happened with the Rosemarys. We also don't have a label urging us to wear big floppy psychedelic hats and trippy paisley clothing, or asking us to hire a fashion consultant, as we also experienced. On the other hand, a good label can do a Hell of a lot for you if they care to: marketing, radio promotion, distribution, tour support. Not that we ever saw any of these things done well, but in the absence of a label you're on your own.
<br>
<br>PB : 'Sweet Country Lullabies�' is a very diverse album. There are elements of fifties rock 'n' roll, sixties folk and nineties grunge as well as country. Why did you decide, therefore, to call it 'Sweet Country Lullabies...' ? Did you intend it as an ironic title ?
<br>
<br>JM: The idea for the title came up as Peter Weldon, our second guitarist, and I were working on the cover layout. Obviously, it comes from the lead track, 'Sweet Country Lullaby', which tends to be a favorite. I think we were conceiving of "lullaby" in a much broader sense, maybe more like "song" or "ditty", The same could be said of "country" ; you might almost substitute "Americana" (our country is America, after all), which in my mind includes all the genres you mentioned and more. I don't think any irony was intended, but perhaps it was our attempt to put a spin on it that would emphasize whatever country-western flavor was present and bring it out, much like salt is said to bring out the natural flavour of good foods.
<br>
<br>PB : Ian, is it true that you recorded the album entirely in your practice space. How long did it take to record the album?
<br>
<br>IP : Well, this is true. About 4 years ago I swore I would never pay to record in a studio again.Instead I would use the money to buy good mics and Pre amps. You see what makes a record sound good isn't lots of fancy flashing lights. It's having time to get it right. When the clock isn't ticking, everyone is much more relaxed. The record took about 8 months to finish, but only because we would stop and start a lot. 3 of the songs were written during those sessions.
<br>
<br>PB : You're the frontman, but are the rest of the band session players or all regular members of the band ?
<br>
<br>IP: We like to think of ourselves as a musical family. Members may go off to do their own projects or take a break from music or whatever, but they are always a part of the family. I can�t imagine ever making a record without Jared Matt, but if I have to go on a tour without him because he is unavailable, that is what I will have to do. In the long run because we allow each other the freedom to do what we want, it keeps the music pure.
<br>
<br>JM: The musicians are not session players because they make the music for love, not money. They are much closer to regular band members in that they hole up in a warehouse space and try to drown out neighboring bands together (read: they practice), they play shows and barbecues, they hang out. As Ian said, it really is a musical family. Where the band member model breaks down lies in the fact that for recordings the musicianship is song-oriented, not player-oriented. Players may change depending on the needs of the song and other factors. Sometimes there is pressure within a band to come up with a keyboard part for every song because there is a permanent keyboard player.With the family model, the emphasis is on songcraft; egos are largely ignored
<br>
<br>PB : Ian, your lyrics are really poetic, yet it has been claimed that you never write any of them down. Is that true ?
<br>
<br>IP: It is true that I do not write down lyrics until I need to. I will write them down if I need to teach them to someone else. But for the most part they reside only in my head.
<br>
<br>PB : You both produced and engineered the album yourself. How much previous experience have you had of producing and engineering? Did you enjoy the experience ?
<br>
<br>IP: I have been messing around with recording for as long as I can remember. I truly love the process. I have recorded demos for friends, and I have always wanted to produce albums, maybe some day I will get the opportunity.If I ever get a budget, however, I would love to hire an engineer, so I could relax a little and let someone else worry about if we are hitting the tape too hard.
<br>
<br>PB : You're also now working on a second album, 'Dear Lord Let This Dirt Redeem Me.' When do you hope to release that? In what ways do you see it as differing from 'Sweet Country Lullabies...'? How many of the same musicians will it involve?
<br>
<br>JM: Ian will be moving to Seattle at the end of October, which means we will be entering uncharted territory as far as An American Starlet is concerned. The recording will go on, and we hope to have a release ready by summer 2002. Believe it or not, many of the same musicians will be involved, thanks to such technological advances as fibre optics, ion transport, and internal combustion. There are a few players whom Ian already knows up in Seattle who may end up on the recording as well, in addition to unforeseen stars and starlets alike. Peter Weldon, who made such great contributions to 'Sweet Country Lullabies', however, leads a group called The Clarkes, and he will continue to focus on their music.
<br>
<br>PB : Do you have plans to release anything else on the Starletsweb label ?
<br>
<br>?IP : Well, yes I do have plans of releasing a tribute record to the Cure titled 'Sick'.I am asking for contributions from all sorts of bands, I have gotten positive responses from, Moses McCartney, The Aislers Set, The 93rds, Charles Atlas (of which Jared Matt is a member), and I have invited many more bands to participate. In fact I would love to have submissions from European Bands as well, so feel free to put out the word. Anyone who is interested can email me at Ian@starletsweb.com. All the proceeds of this album will go to the American Red Cross. Deadlines for submissions will be February 15th 2002.
<br>
<br>PB : You have said in the past that you think that you feel that An American Starlet has more perhaps to offer Europe than the United States, and that you think perhaps that America may not yet be ready for An American Starlet. Why do you feel that ?
<br>
<br>IP: I could be wrong but it just seems like the European music fan is less concerned with boob jobs and syncopated dancing and more concerned with songs.
<br>
<br>JM: Well, I haven't been to Eurpose (as I call it) in some time, but my impression is that the European market has always been more receptive to music that includes dark elements, that is raw, that is ethereal or subtle. Add the fact that humans seek out the exotic ; being from across an ocean may actually increase our appeal in Europe.
<br>
<br>PB: Ian, you're also planning to go it alone and to play some European dates by yourself? When will that be? Where will European audiences be able to see you?
<br>
<br>IP : I could be over there as soon as this spring. It might be by myself or with others. It is really just a matter of economics, I can tour Europe by myself for next to nothing, but the show is greatly improved by the addition of the other players. The bottom line is that we will be 'Bringing it to the people' very soon.
<br>
<br>PB: Do you have any other plans for the near future?
<br>
<br>IP: Well, as Matt pointed out, I am moving to Seattle in search of more musically fertile grounds. San Francisco has taken a turn for the worst for artists of all kinds. So we shall see where that leads. Also, there is this Starlet in Norway that I would love to work with again. I will do my best to make that happen.
<br>
<br>JM: Hmm. I reckon I might help Ian haul himself up to the North West and check the place out myself. We will resume Starlet recording via satellite once Ian gets set up up North. My other project, Charles Atlas, has a new recording coming out and shows to play. I gotsta go to work. I gotsta eat. Plastic arts, video, and writing projects to further. And, of course, romance to pursue. Oh, but there is infinite time if we know how to exploit it.
<br>
<br>PB : Thank you both of you.
