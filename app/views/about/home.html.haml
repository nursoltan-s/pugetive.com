        Once the digital hub (remember those?) for my professional and amateur creative projects, this site suffered from years of neglect and had to be retrofitted to match modern construction code. What you're witnessing is a complete rebuild from scratch. And it's all been happening intermittently while traveling overseas until late 2017&hellip;so you can expect lots of construction noise, plumber crack, schedule SNAFUs, and so on.

      %p You can tell a person is lacking for side projects when they're busy abstracting their creative life into a relational database. Offer me something else to work on, won't you? Currently seeking juicy and inspiring work in New York City.
