      Once the digital hub (remember those?) for my professional and amateur creative projects, this site suffered from enough years of neglect that it had to be retrofitted to match modern construction code. What you're witnessing is a complete rebuild from scratch&mdash;expect lots of contruction noise, schedule complications, plumber crack, and so on.
